Move all negative elements to end 


In an array the questions say to move the neagtive integers to the  one  end( at the end)

Understanding :

 step 1 :  So in an array there are both posiitve integers as well as negative integers. so will make two  different loops one to store postive integers and another to one to store negative integers.
step 2 : using "TWO POINTER TECHNIQUE".
step 3 : make an int n for the length of the array.
         make  and integer J  to track the position array  whehre the next element  should be placed.
         an temp array to  store the element in the desired order.
step.4  //  main steps
     1. search positive elements and then copy in the temp array.
     2. again start from begining and search for negativ element.
     3. copy now temp array to theh given (orginal) array.
